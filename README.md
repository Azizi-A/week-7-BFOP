## About The Project
This is a project created as part of the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) curriculum, week 7. The task was to build a REST API which returns JSON data. [The project requirements.](https://founders-and-coders.gitbook.io/coursebook/curriculum/rest-apis/project)

## User stories

### Core

- **As an API user, I want to**: get a list of all available resources
- **As an API user, I want to**: get all the information on a specific resource
- **As an API user, I want to**: create a new resource
- **As an API user, I want to**: update an existing resource
- **As an API user, I want to**: delete an existing resource
- **As an API user, I want to**: only be able to change an existing resource if I am authenticated to do so

Since this project is open-ended you'll need to write your own more specific user stories once you know what you want to build.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] An Express server that only returns JSON
- [x] A Postgres database to store the data
- [x] Endpoints for creating, reading, updating & deleting resources
- [x] Token-based authentication so only the owner of a resource can change it
- [x] Correct headers and response metadata
- [x] Error-handling to make it easy to use the API to build something
- [ ] Tests for server routes and database access (*server routes tests outstanding*)
- [x] Not process user input as SQL commands
- [x] Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)

### Stretch criteria

- [x] GitHub Actions CI setup to run your tests when you push
